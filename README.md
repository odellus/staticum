# _staticum_

### The transparent cryptocurrency that's _good for the environment_.

We're not like other cryptocurrencies. We're very open about the fact this is all a scam.

Unlike other cryptocurrencies you can trust staticum to retain the same value as I will sell anyone on earth a staticum for $1 US, thus ensuring a stable coin market for the future of our global economy.

#### How it works

You send me $1 US, and I will send you a randomly generated key that I keep a copy of in order to verify your staticum purchase. If you want to sell it to someone else for $1, go ahead. I don't know why they'd want it, but cryptocurrency doesn't make any god damned sense lol. It's just digital scarcity economics ffs. They use as much energy mining bitcoin as Switzerland ffs.

Not us here at _**staticum**_. We just use python to generate a bunch of random keys and if you're goofy enough to send me a dollar for one I will gladly take your money for the good of the planet.
